### Notes
* QSFP-40G-SR4 (https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/276775381020)
  * Requires MTP-12 cable - https://www.fs.com/uk/products/68017.html?attribute=6129&id=3946649
  * SR = short range - expensive cable, cheaper (not cheap) transciever
  * LR = long range - cheap cable, very expensive transciever
  * Anything under 100m, use SR (probably)
